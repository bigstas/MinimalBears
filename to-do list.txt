For Beta:
1. authentication / user accounts (mostly Guy)
2. finalised text on About page (Staś and Guy)
    - second draft to be reviewed
    - get links to link to PDFs rather than websites - this is surprisingly hard and poorly documented with React Router
3. internationalisation (mostly Staś)
    - mostly done structurally
    - About page needs to be sorted before we get the translations ready for that
    - need translations into various languages
4. examples on selector buttons (mostly Staś)
    - client-side mostly implemented
    - make the switching between examples happen according to the time of hover, not globally on the page -- DONE
    - TODO: server-side bringing up the examples to feed to the buttons (once we've done that then we're done on this point)
5. some sort of interface for admins to approve audio (probably Staś and Guy)
    - Moderation page exists client side, need server-side connections to make work
6. expansion into further languages (Staś and Guy)
    - add options for moderators on moderation page
7. any further styling - esp. Record page and authentication pages (mostly Gergő)
8. any images to be added (Gergő)
    - a logo
    - a placeholder image for the profile page? (tbd)
    - any changes to the favicon?
9. connections to social media (Staś and Gergő)
    - Twitter button functional, needs styling
    - Facebook button only possible if the app is registered with Facebook (so people can "like" it)
10. anything fed back from the user tests (Guy, Staś, and Gergő)
    - Arena needs options other than "Go Again" once the user has finished (e.g. "Main Menu")
    - the Arena panel appears to have a slider on the side in Chrome, as if the contents don't fit. To be removed.
    - the Progress button in the Arena should be placed to the bottom-right to suggest more strongly that that's what is to be pressed next
    - more instructions on the Record page (tutorial?)
    - Rare words can be offputting (e.g. remembering how to pronounce "bough") - maybe it could be worth adding an option to remove an item.  In this particular case, we have another homophone which is orthographically ambiguous ("bow"), so an alternative would be to show all homophones and add the comment for the item.
    - stronger colour contrast on some of the buttons
    - get SSL certificate so that Record page will work in security-conscious Chrome
11. new/better sounds for feedback (Gergő)
12. improvement in user experience on Arena page (mostly Gergő)
13. testing code (code that checks everything is working correctly) (Guy and Staś)
    - Jest is online with dummy.test.js
    - need to put in testing code for other files
14. use of more efficient and better-scaling db calls (Guy)
15. profile with user data, like statistics (mostly Staś)
    - started charts on profile page
    - will need to arrange for data about users' activity to be logged in the db for this to be useful
16. clean up all the warnings appearing when the app runs (Staś with Guy's help) -- DONE as these no longer appear
17. different pages depending on whether the user is logged in or not (Staś)
    - home page - changes started
    - record page - should only be accessible to logged-in users
18. SEO - we need the page to appear in Google searches (currently it doesn't) (Staś and Guy) -- DONE it appears on Google search
19. An interface for audio editing (Staś)
    - started Edit page using BBC's peaks.js
    - email Thomas Parisot at irfs@bbc.co.uk (this is the project website) -- SENT, waiting for reply
    
Do we have sheath vs sheaf?
