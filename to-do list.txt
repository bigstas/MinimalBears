For Beta:
1. DONE
2. finalised text on About page (Staś and Guy)
    - second draft to be reviewed
    - get links to link to PDFs rather than websites - this is surprisingly hard and poorly documented with React Router
3. internationalisation (mostly Staś)
    - need translations into various languages 
4. examples on selector buttons (mostly Staś)
    - TODO: server-side bringing up the examples to feed to the buttons
5. CANCELLED (now using only Edit page, no Moderation page)
6. CANCELLED? (expansion into further languages (Staś and Guy)
    - this should be centrally controlled, and can be done by Guy adding parts to the database through pgAdmin as and when we decide to?)
7. DONE
8. any images to be added (Gergő)
    - a logo
    - a placeholder image for the profile page? (tbd)
    - any changes to the favicon?
    - great free open-source icon libraries to check out: http://mariodelvalle.github.io/CaptainIconWeb/; http://mapsk.in/
9. DONE
10. anything fed back from the user tests (Guy, Staś, and Gergő)
    - the Progress button in the Arena should be placed to the bottom-right to suggest more strongly that that's what is to be pressed next
    - Rare words can be offputting (e.g. remembering how to pronounce "bough") - maybe it could be worth adding an option to remove an item.  In this particular case, we have another homophone which is orthographically ambiguous ("bow"), so an alternative would be to show all homophones and add the comment for the item.
    - stronger colour contrast on some of the buttons
    - get SSL certificate so that Record page will work in security-conscious Chrome
11. new/better sounds for feedback (Gergő)
12. DONE? (improvement in user experience on Arena page (mostly Gergő))
13. testing code (code that checks everything is working correctly) (Guy and Staś)
    - Jest is online with dummy.test.js
    - need to put in testing code for other files
14. use of more efficient and better-scaling db calls (Guy)
15. profile with user data, like statistics (mostly Staś)
    - charts mostly ready client-side on Profile page
    - will need to arrange for data about users' activity to be logged in the db for this to be useful
16. DONE
17. DONE
18. DONE
19. An interface for audio editing (Staś)
    - edit page mostly ready client-side, needs db connections
20. DONE
21. Keypress events in Arena - either fix or remove
