For Beta:
1. authentication / user accounts (mostly Guy)
2. finalised text on About page (Staś and Guy)
3. internationalisation (mostly Staś)
    - mostly done structurally
    - About page needs to be sorted before we get the translations ready for that
    - need translations into various languages
4. examples on selector buttons (mostly Staś)
5. some sort of interface for admins to approve audio (probably Staś and Guy)
    - started as Edit page
6. expansion into further languages (Staś and Guy)
7. any further styling - esp. Record page and authentication pages (mostly Gergő)
8. any images to be added (Gergő)
    - a logo
    - a placeholder image for the profile page? (tbd)
    - any changes to the favicon?
9. potentially connections to social media (probably Staś and Guy)
10. anything fed back from the user tests (Guy, Staś, and Gergő)
11. new/better sounds for feedback (Gergő)
12. improvement in user experience on Arena page (mostly Gergő)
13. testing code (code that checks everything is working correctly) (Guy and Staś)
14. use of more efficient and better-scaling db calls (Guy)
15. possibly some sort of profile with user data, like statistics (mostly Staś)
    - started charts on profile page
    - will need to arrange for data about users' activity to be logged in the db for this to be useful
16. Clean up all the warnings appearing when the app runs (Staś with Guy's help)
