LOCAL POSTGRES INSTRUCTIONS
0. correct permissions
1. run database server with [anywhere]$ postgres -D usr/local/var/postgres
2. create db using [anywhere]$ createdb NAME
3A. [if there are migrations] migrate the database with (own .knex directory) .knex$ knex migrate:latest
3B. [if creating from scratch] add tables as desired, making sure that every column has a column named 'id' with unique elements
4. run the app with (own app) APP$ ./run-app.sh


DEPLOYMENT TO GANDI INSTRUCTIONS
(See also docs at https://wiki.gandi.net/en/simple/git)
0*. create local directory for git (if not done so): $ mkdir {vhost} , i.e. $ mkdir www.minimalbears.com
1. go to that directory: $ cd www.minimalbears.com
2*. initialise git (if directory just created): $ git init
3*. connect this directory to the remote directory (if not yet done so): $ git remote add origin ssh+git://639050@git.dc2.gpaas.net/default.git
3+1/2*. pull the remote branch: $ git pull origin master
4. add files to current commit (-A is "all") $ git add -A
5. commit: $ git commit -m "Version 0.0.2" (this is the text about what you just did / are committing)
6. push: $ git push origin master
7. deploy: $ ssh 639050@git.dc2.gpaas.net 'deploy default.git'
[On Windows, install ssh: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH]


BUILD IT, ADD IT, COMMIT IT, PUSH IT (... deploy it)
-1. inside MinimalBearsBuild run $ git pull origin master
0. inside MinimalBears run $ meteor build ../MinimalBearsBuild/ --directory --architecture os.linux.x86_64
1a. inside MinimalBearsBuild run $ git add -A 
["git add ." stages new files and modified files, but not deletions; "git add -A" stages all three]
[make sure not to delete "main.js", which does not come directly from Meteor]
1b. to check that things are added, run $ git status
2. $ git commit -m "<your message here for future reference>"
3. $ git push origin master
4. $ ssh 639050@git.dc2.gpaas.net 'deploy default.git'
5. $ ssh 639050@console.dc2.gpaas.net 'npm install' ?


NPM INSTRUCTIONS
(Installing npm modules, rather than Meteor Atmosphere modules)
0. run $ npm install --save react react-dom react-addons-pure-render-mixin
(Perhaps we can put these in dependencies (in package.json?) and then npm can sort it all out...)


GIVE YOURSELF PERMISSION TO EXECUTE FILE
chmod +x [filename] , e.g.
chmod +x test-app.sh

KILL LOCAL POSTGRES POSTMASTER ON MAC (a special note to Sta≈õ)
0. If you shut down the terminal without "killing" the PostgreSQL server, then there is a (temporary) file called postmaster.pid that will still be there. If you try to re-run that server afterwards by reloading the terminal and typing:
[anywhere]$ postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres/
...then you will get (something like) the following error:
FATAL:  lock file "postmaster.pid" already exists
HINT:  Is another postmaster (PID 682) running in data directory "/usr/local/var/postgres"?
- by the way, the PID might be a different number (i.e. other than 682) (more on this below)
1. As far as I can tell, this file is deleted on shutdown, so if you restart the computer it should be fine, but that's obviously a pain.
2. So a better way to do this is to "kill" the postmaster (sounds brutal, but nobody gets hurt). In order to do this, you need to know the postmaster's ID number to identify him. To do this, you can either read the number out of the error as shown above, or you can run:
[anywhere]$ cat /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid
The PID will be given in the first line of the response.
3. Then you need to run the kill command: [anywhere]$ kill 682  // or whatever number the PID is
4. Now you can run postgres again as normal: [anywhere]$ postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres/
